# Features
Despite modeling this game almost exclusively off the GBA style of Fire Emblem I did want to bring in elements from other games, as well as add some original ideas on my end.
- Things I wanted to ensure I kept from the GBA style - the 'Rescue' ability, different types of magic (especially dark magic), and how the preparation phase is set up.
- Things I wanted to bring over from the Shadow Dragon - BALLISTICIANS, that imitation guy, and a couple other things. The knock off ballista you get in Sacred Stones does not count.
- Things I wanted to bring over from Path of Radiance - the "survive" objective (does not appear in Shadow Dragon after all) and I am considering introducing the Laguz class, or something comparable.
- Original ideas - adding playable "entombed" units, introducing 4 different factions in play at once (your units, friendly / ally, enemy, and a fourth party that can act in several different ways) - this would probably only be one or two chapters at most. Also adding turn limits to certain maps - while most maps will have unlimited turns (especially maps with Arenas), not every chapter should allow the player to very precisely move units over the course of 80 turns. If incentives like getting to chests and villages before thieves and bandits isn't motivation enough, then it can be enforced.
- Some TOUGH enemies. Think along the lines of the Draco Zombies in Sacred Stones with high health and a decent attack, but not vulnerable to special weapons.

# Other sources
To highlight some of the classic FE features I've added to the game, I compiled some basic screen recordings and uploaded them to a playlist on youtube. Seemed the easiest way to embed them here as well as bring traffic to both sites.<br>

That playlist highlights around 8+ different features and explains them pretty well, so I won't go into more depth on them again here. That channel has a few other gameplay videos I've uploaded if you want to check them out.
