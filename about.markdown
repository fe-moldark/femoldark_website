# About
I think the home page does a fair job summarizing this site, so I won't go more in depth here. If you are interested in my other website that has more to do with cybersecurity and other personal projects I am working on, you can find that here: <a href="https://wesleykent.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wesleykent.com</a>
<br><br>
As for myself, I am currently studying Cybersecurity with a concentration in Wireless and Mobile Security at American Military University, and set to graduate in the fall of 2023. I've earned my CompTIA Security+, Network+, and A+ certifications and am working towards the Linux+ and CySA+ right now.
