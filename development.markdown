# History of the game
This game has gone through multiple overhauls, mainly when I realized certain code structures I had written made no sense, which to be fair to myself I did start this as a teenager. Here's a throw back to how the game first appeared in roughly 2015 / 2016:<br>

This was riddled with so many errors and could be broken in so many ways, thankfully those have all been taken care of.
Since then, I have added what feels like a hundred other features and abilities, heavily updated the graphics, and the code itself has grown and evolved as a result.

# Where this project is at and where it is going
Right now I am focused on finishing the game console so I can stop worrying about the hardware and solely focus on the software. As I was still working on the software I realized I needed to bite the bullet once again and restructure some things. Thankfully this does not have to do with the game itself, rather with how unit and dialogue files are formatted. This will take some time, and it will also affect how the [Create Chapter program](/creating_chapters/) I built works.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, I can't solely focus on developing this project since I am going to school, working, and studying for certifications, so any work on this is done when I can find the time. Once I am more available I would like to start rewriting things and continue to add new features to the game. Top of that list is adding the 'Rescue' feature from the GBA games and some unique staves for the healers and mages.
<br><br>
The only other challenge has been transitioning the game to play on a Linux based system instead of Windows. This includes trying to install outdated modules, changing the file structure, some audio files no longer want to load for whatever reason, and more. Headaches galore.

Here are some screenshots of what the game looks like now:<br>
