# In-Game Achievements
I decided to add an absolutely useless weapon to the game just for fun, and then it was suggested to me to turn killing an enemy boss with that weapon into an achievement. That led me down a rabbit hole of making up mainly just funny achievements for the game. Some play into cliches from the Fire Emblem series, others are inspired by Star Wars memes, some even come from other Fire Emblem creators over on YouTube. I had a good time thinking up all of these, and suggestions are always welcome to help add to this list. Part of me did die inside when I realized I will need to program in all of these checks for the achievements, but that's tomorrow's problem.
